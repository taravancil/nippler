Nippler is a tool for removing pesky female nipples from photos and replacing
them with male nipples. Or you can use it to put male nipples on any
photo - that's quite fun too.

## Development

`npm install` or `yarn install` then `npm start` to build the files
and start up a local development server.

Warning: Nippler is still pretty janky on Firefox. Try Chrome instead.
